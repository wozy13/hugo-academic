abstract: Energy absorption devices are widely used to mitigate damage from
  collisions and impact loads. Due to the inherent uncertainty of possible
  impact characteristics, passive energy absorbers with fixed mechanical
  properties are not capable of serving in versatile application scenarios.
  Here, we explore a deployable design concept where origami tubes can extend,
  lock, and are intended to absorb energy through crushing (buckling and
  plasticity). This system concept is unique because origami deployment can
  increase the crushing distance between two impacting bodies and can tune the
  energy absorption characteristics. We show that the stiffness, peak crushing
  force, and total energy absorption of the origami tubes all increase with the
  deployed state. We present numerical and experimental studies that investigate
  these tunable behaviors under both static and dynamic scenarios. The
  energy-absorbing performance of the deployed origami tubes is slightly better
  than conventional prismatic tubes in terms of total absorbed energy and peak
  force. When the origami tubes are only partially deployed, they exhibit a
  nearly elastic collapse behavior; however, when they are locked in a more
  deployed configuration, they can experience non-recoverable crushing with
  higher energy absorption. Parametric studies reveal that the geometric design
  of the tube can control the nonlinear relationship between energy absorption
  and deployment. A physical model shows the potential of the self-locking after
  deployment. This concept for deployable energy-absorbing origami tubes can
  enable future protective systems with on-demand properties for different
  impact scenarios.
