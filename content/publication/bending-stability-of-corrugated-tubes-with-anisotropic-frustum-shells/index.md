abstract: Thin-walled corrugated tubes that have a bending multistability, such
  as the bendy straw, allow for variable orientations over the tube length.
  Compared to the long history of corrugated tubes in practical applications,
  the mechanics of the bending stability and how it is affected by the cross
  sections and other geometric parameters remain unknown. To explore the
  geometry-driven bending stabilities, we used several tools, including a
  reduced-order simulation package, a simplified linkage model, and physical
  prototypes. We found the bending stability of a circular two-unit corrugated
  tube is dependent on the longitudinal geometry and the stiffness of the crease
  lines that connect separate frusta. Thinner shells, steeper cones, and weaker
  creases are required to achieve bending bi-stability. We then explored how the
  bending stability changes as the cross section becomes elongated or distorted
  with concavity. We found the bending bi-stability is favored by deep and
  convex cross sections, while wider cross sections with a large concavity
  remain mono-stable. The different geometries influence the amounts of
  stretching and bending energy associated with bending the tube. The stretching
  energy has a bi-stable profile and can allow for a stable bent configuration,
  but it is counteracted by the bending energy which increases monotonically.
  The findings from this work can enable informed design of corrugated tube
  systems with desired bending stability behavior.
